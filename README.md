# Moodify

## Description

This site is designed to help set the music for your mood by recommending playlists based on time of day, temperature, and general weather outside upon user zipcode input

It also allows users to customize their preferences, describing how they feel, or what type of music they are in the mood for, to expand their playlist recommendations even more. 

The background smoothly transitions to reflect time of day and weather as well to further set the environment

In order for this site to function properly, you will need to authorize it to access your spotify. Because this is entirely a front end website, this access token will expire every hour. 


## Code

This website is split into some basic components. The index.html file is located in the root of the project, along with the assets folder which contains the remainder of the files. It is split up into four folders: 
* css
* icons
* images
* javascript

The javascript is all in one app.js file. The css styles are all located in a single styles.css file in the css folder. Any background images can be found in the images folder, and the moving icons in the icons folder.
