# Moodify

## Description: 

This site is designed to help set the music for your mood by recommending playlists based on time of day, temperature, and general weather outside upon user zipcode input

It also allows users to customize their preferences, describing how they feel, or what type of music they are in the mood for, to expand their playlist recommendations even more. 

The background smoothly transitions to reflect time of day and weather as well to further set the environment

## Code

* Pulls from two APIs to get its data
  - Openweather API
  - Spotify API

* Uses: 
  - Javascript
  - AJAX
  - Jquery
  - HTML5/CSS3

* Limitations: 
  - This project currently requires an access token, which expires every hour, in order to run correctly - it is meant to be built with a back-end.
  -- I will be working to resolve this to get it to refresh automatically


The site is deployed at https://emcoraccio.github.io/Project1/
